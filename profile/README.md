Storytelling. Meet data.

Our program teaches students to discover, verify, contextualize and publish truths that inform all citizens; 
to hold government institutions accountable and serve as a check on powers that threaten democracy and the public good; 
and to tell stories that are as accurate as they are independent, as compelling as they are significant,
and as hard-hitting as they are even-handed. *Check out our [curriculum overview](https://journalism.stanford.edu/curriculum) and [mission statement](https://journalism.stanford.edu/mission) to learn more about the program.*

We run the [Big Local News](https://github.com/biglocalnews) project at Stanford, which provides opportunities for students to engage in collaborative data and software projects for the news.
